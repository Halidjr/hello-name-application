# Hello Name Application

A simple interactive web app that greets users by their name!  
This project demonstrates how to use **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** together to create dynamic, user-interactive web pages.

## How It Works
1. The user clicks the **“Click on Me!”** button.  
2. A pop-up prompt appears asking for their name.  
3. The text “World!” updates to display their name dynamically.  

**Example:**
- Before: “Hello World!”
- After: “Hello Halid!”
